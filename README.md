# CSC301 - Foundations of Programming Languages

1. Why study programming languages?
    * Communalities/differences
    * Computational paradigms
    * Language evolution/design
1. Meet our languages:
    * Python - OO/Imperative
    * Haskell - Functional
    * Prolog - Logic
1. Python
    * The basics
    * Objects and inheritance
    * Multiple inheritance
    * The diamond inheritance graph problem
    * Higher order functions
    * Iterators (internal/external/generator)
    * Mapping
    * Types and type hierarchies
1. Interlude - Language specification
    * Syntax/Semantics
    * Grammars
    * Parse tree/derivation trees
    * Semantics: interpretations of the parse tree
    * Ambiguous grammars
    * Lexical analysis
    * Parser generators
      * Lex/YACC
1. Interlude - Language Tools
    * The read–eval–print loop (REPL)
    * Debuggers
    * Interpreters vs compilers
1. Interlude - Memory management
    * Typical process memory
    * Parameter passing
      * Pass by value
      * Pass by reference
1. Haskell
    * Lists and tuples
    * Types and type classes
    * Functions and pattern matching
    * Let, where, and case
    * Recursion/thinking recursively
    * Higher order functions (mapping)
    * Algebraic data types
    * Functional IO
1. Interlude - Recursion
    * How do programming language implement recursive functions?
    * The runtime stack and stack frames
      * Using a debugger to look at the runtime stack
1. Interlude - Polymorphism
    * Duck typing
    * Subtype polymorphism
    * Parametric polymorphism
1. Prolog
    * First-order logic
      * Predicates and quantification
      * Modus ponens
    * Logic programs
      * Facts and rules
    * Querying/executing a program
      * Proof trees
    * Arithmetic
    * IO
1. Interlude - Scoping
    * scoping rules
    * name spaces
    * static vs. dynamic scoping
1. Interlude - Formal semantics
    * Semantics via abstract interpretation
      * Operational semantics
    * Building abstract interpreters using Prolog
