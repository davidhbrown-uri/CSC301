-- typematch patterns

-- works with primitive types
let %integer = 1.
let %real = 2.0.
let %string = "Hello There!".

-- works with user defined types
structure A with
    data a.
    data b.
end

let %A = A(1,2).

-- typematch patterns together with constraint patterns
-- allow us to limit what is stored in a variable
let i:%integer = 1.
